Scenario: As part of a migration project, our team was tasked with setting up and managing over 50 Azure Virtual Machines across development, staging, and production environments.

Steps Taken:

Defined Infrastructure in Code:

Created Terraform modules to standardize VM creation (resource group, network interface, public IP, NSG, etc.).

Used variables and workspaces to handle different environments (dev, stage, prod).

Automation & Scalability:

Wrote reusable Terraform code to spin up VMs with custom configurations (CPU, memory, OS, tags).

Automated provisioning using terraform apply via Jenkins pipeline triggered on Git commits.

Security & Networking:

Integrated VM deployment with Azure Key Vault for secure password/SSH key management.

Attached VMs to specific virtual networks and subnets with NSGs and route tables.

State Management:

Used Azure Storage Account for remote backend to store and lock Terraform state files securely.

Cost Control & Tagging:

Applied consistent tagging (Owner, Environment, Project) for billing and lifecycle management.

Added auto-shutdown schedules for non-prod VMs using Azure DevTest Labs and Terraform.
